Pull Instagram photos to detect what's in them with the Google Vision API.
You will need to authenticate to the Google Vision API with your own credentials.

To install dependencies, run the following command

$ pip install instagram-scraper

Insert profile name you wish to scrape in the csv.
Run script.py
Folders and text files will be generated with what was detected in the photos, and if a match to "travel" or "graduation" is detected, the corresponding ad will open on your default image viewer.
